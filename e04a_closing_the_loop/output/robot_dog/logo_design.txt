- Elements of the logo:

1. Robot Dog:
   - Body: The body of the robot dog should be a geometric shape (for instance, a rectangle or a rounded rectangle). It should have a shiny metallic finish, and could be designed to display metallic textures. The color of the body should be a metallic grey to give it the robot-like look.

2. Head: 
   - The head of the robot dog could take a geometric shape such as a circle or an oval. It should be attached above the body and should also have a shiny metallic finish and color.

3. Eyes: 
   - The eyes of the robot dog can be two small black circles. They should be present on the head of the dog, equidistant from each other.

4. Ears: 
   - The ears should be triangles or semi-circles, present at the top two sides of the head. They should also have a metallic finish and color to match the body and the head.

5. Legs:
   - The robot dog should have four legs. Each leg could be designed as two connected rectangles to illustrate joints. They should also have a metallic finish and color to match the body. 

6. Tail:
    - The tail of the robot dog should be a narrow rectangle extending from the back of the body. It should also have a metallic finish and color like the rest of the body.

These are general guidelines and the shapes and sizes can be adjusted according to the overall look and balance of the logo.

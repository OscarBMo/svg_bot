Title: Sunset Landscape

Logo elements and design:

1. Mountains: 
   - The mountains will form the main imagery of the logo.
   - They will have a rocky texture to reflect the real-life ruggedness of mountains.
   - Colors: dark shades of brown and grey.

2. River: 
   - A river will flow from the mountains downwards to show elevation and movement.
   - The river should look elegant and calm, with a slightly wavy pattern for naturalness.
   - Colors: various shades of blue, with some white for river foam.

3. Sunset:
   - The sunset will be visualized with a large, bright, circular sun just at the corner of one of the mountains.
   - The sun should be depicted as setting or half-hidden behind the mountains.
   - Colors: bright yellow to orange gradient for the sun with slight red tones for the setting effect.
   
4. Sky: 
   - The sky will take up the upper part of the logo.
   - It should fade from a bright warm colour near the sun into a cool colour far from it to mirror the transition from day to night.
   - Colors: a gradient blend of orange just above the sun, fading into cooler shades of blue and finally black at the top.

5. Sunrays:
   - Subtle rays should emanate from the sun to show its brightness.
   - The rays should be softer in color compared to the sun, and should overlay the other elements slightly.
   - Colors: soft yellow to transparent gradient.

Overall, the elements should be positioned to resemble a picturesque landscape, with the river acting as a leading line guiding the viewer's eye from the mountains to the sun. The colors in the logo should gradually change from cool to warm, symbolizing the transition from day to night in the setting of the sun.

- Logo Elements and Design

1. Cat Body: The body of the feral cat should be sleek and muscular to represent the sturdy nature of a feral cat. It should have typical cat contours but with a rough, slightly rugged look to depict its feral characteristics. The body should be filled with different gradients of blue color to give it a more realistic and dimensional look.

2. Cat Head: The cat's head should be drawn with sharp, symmetrical features and angular shapes to give the feeling of a wild creature. The facial expression should be serious and a bit aggressive. The color should also be in varying gradients of blue.

3. Cat Eyes: The eyes of the cat should be quite distinct and expressive, possibly bright yellow for contrast with the blue, and should portray a fierce and intimidating look. 

4. Cat Ears: The ears of the cat should be pointy and upright, characteristic of alertness. They should also bear the same blue gradient color scheme as the rest of the body.

5. Cat Tail: The tail of the feral cat should be portrayed as bushy and somewhat unkempt, with the same color scheme, to emphasise the wild nature of the cat.

6. Cat Paws: The cat's paws should be slightly lifted and claws partly visible to showcase the cat's readiness for action. They should also follow the blue gradient color scheme.

Overall, the objective is to create a visually striking image of a feral cat in hues of blue.

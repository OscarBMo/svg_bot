- Logo Elements Decomposition:

1. Viking Ship:
   - Hull: The ship's hull should be in a curved silhouette shape, resembling an elongated 'U'. It should be symmetrical so as to depict the traditional Viking longboat design. The color of the hull should be dark to denote a silhouette. 
   
   - Oars: The silhouette of multiple oars should be designed along the fringe of the hull. Each oar should be a short straight line that physiologically aligns with the shape of the hull. The color of the oars should also be dark to maintain the silhouette effect. 

   - Mast: A tall, straight line should be designed to denote the mast of the Viking ship. The mast should start at the base of the hull and stretch upwards from the center of it. The color should be dark to follow the silhouette theme.

   - Sail: The silhouette of the sail should be designed having two sides connected to the mast. The shape may be designed as a rectangle stretching from the top of the hull to about three-fourths of the mast height. The sail can be filled with a manifest pattern or left blank, but the color should be dark to portray a silhouette. 

   - Dragon head & tail: The silhouette of a dragon head and tail should be designed at both ends of the hull. The dragon's head should look fierce and the tail should be designed to look like it's interconnected with the hull.
   
2. Waves:
   - Wave Lines: There should be multiple curved lines beneath the hull to depict waves. These lines should rise and fall to imitate the natural movement of sea waves. The color should be dark to match the silhouette theme of the logo.

# SVG Bot

This is an experiemental project to test the capabilities of LLMs in generating SVG files using Rust's `rig` crate. The repo is divided into several folders, each containing a different approach to the problem. The goal is to compare different approaches with different levels of complexity.

The generation of SVG files is an interesting problem since it lies in the intersection of programming, design, and multimodal data, so there are many different ways to approach it or many "degrees of freedom" to explore.

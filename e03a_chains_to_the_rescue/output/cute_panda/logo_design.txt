## Logo Elements and Descriptions

1. **Panda**:
   The centerpiece of the logo is a panda bear. This panda should be designed in a cute style which means it will have exaggerated features such as large round eyes, small nose and mouth, and round body shape. The panda's fur is almost entirely black, except for its middle face area, the belly and its paws that are white.

2. **Eyes**:
   The panda's eyes should be oval, relatively large, and full of innocence and curiosity. The eyes are black, with a smaller white oval within it, to give the appearance of gleam, making it more lifelike and cute.

3. **Bamboo**:
   The panda should be portrayed as it's eating a bamboo stick. The bamboo should be tall and thick with tufts of leaves, and should be green. One of the panda's paws are holding the bamboo stick, while the panda is biting into it.

4. **Panda's Position**:
   The panda can be sitting down in a relaxed position with one paw raised to hold the bamboo, while the other paw rests leisurely on its belly. This will create a relaxed and adorable appearance.
   
5. **Logo Background**:
   The background should be light and subtle, possibly a very light shade of green to complement the bamboo, or white to contrast with the panda. The idea is to not divert attention from the main elements that are the panda and the bamboo.

6. **Logo Title**: 
   The title, "Cute Panda", should be written in playful, youthful, and friendly fonts. It should be relatively big and located either at the top or bottom of the logo depending on where it looks best. The color could follow the black and white theme of the panda itself. However, the designer may experiment with different colors that don't clash with the main image, such as green to match the bamboo.

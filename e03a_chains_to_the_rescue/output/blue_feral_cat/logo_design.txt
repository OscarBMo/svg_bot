## Elements of the Logo

1. Cat Figure:
   - Description: Generate a silhouette or line art representation of a feral cat in a standing or stalking position. This should be rough and rugged to emphasize the feral nature of the cat.
   - Color: The cat should be in different shades of blue, with darker shades outlining the key features like the eyes, ears, tail, and the fur, and lighter blue for the rest of the body.
   - Size: The cat figure should be the central element of the logo and should be sized proportionally to fit in the center of the logo frame.

2. Eyes of the Cat:
   - Description: Eyes should be depicted as glowing and fierce. They should be somewhat oval, slanted, and slightly larger than usual to reflect the cat's wild nature.
   - Color: The eyes can be a radiant shade of blue, different than the body color, to make them stand out.

3. Background:
   - Description: Create a simple and minimalistic background that does not distract from the main image of the feral cat.
   - Color: A lighter shade of blue which compliments the color of the cat or a simple white to contrast the Blue Feral Cat.
   
4. Title:
   - Description: The title "Blue Feral Cat" should be depicted beneath the cat figure. The font should be bold enough to stand visible yet not overshadow the main logo design.
   - Color: The color of the title can be a dark shade of blue to contrast the lighter back color.

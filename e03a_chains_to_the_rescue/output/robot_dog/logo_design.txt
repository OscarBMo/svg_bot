Title: Robot Dog

### Elements Description:

1. Dog body:
    - Main body: should be shaped like a typical dog torso, but with a futuristic, robotic design.
    - Material: should be shiny and metallic.
    - Color: Silver, to give an impression of a metal body.
    - Size: Should cover the main part of the logo, but leave room for other elements.

2. Dog Head:
    - Shape: Should be designed like a typical dog head but with clear signs of a robotic design, such as an antenna or mechanical ears.
    - Material: Same as the body, shiny, and metallic.
    - Color: Silver, to match the body and follow the same theme. 
    - Size: Proportional to the body.

3. Dog Legs:
    - Shape: Must be in a form of mechanical jointed limbs. The upper part of the legs should be slightly thicker than the ends.
    - Material: Similar to the body, shiny and metallic.
    - Color: Same color as the body and Head (Silver).
    - Size: In proportion to the body and Head.

4. Dog Tail: 
    - Shape: Swirly or jagged, indicating it's a robotic part rather than a natural tail.
    - Material: Shiny and metallic, consistent with the rest of the elements.
    - Color: Silver, to harmonize with the dog's body, head, and legs.
    - Size: Proportional but not too long, should not take too much space in the design.

5. Eyes:
    - Shape: Oval but with a slight glow to indicate a power source.
    - Color: Bright Blue, to contrast with the silver body and also imply the robotic nature.
    - Size: Proportional and noticeable, should give the dog a lively look.

6. Background:
    - Should be kept simple to not detract from the main logo â€” a color that contrasts well with silver, like a dark-blue or black, would work well.

Remember to keep all design elements sleek and futuristic to match the robotic dog concept in a recognizable and attractive way.

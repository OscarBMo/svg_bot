The SVG code provided above is correct, adheres to the SVG standards and should display the desired graphics correctly. There are no changes necessary for this SVG code. All used SVG elements (like '<rect>', '<ellipse>', '<line>', '<circle>' and '<polyline>') are used correctly, including their attributes.

Please note that this is a static SVG image. While the SVG elements are well-documented with comments, if there would be a need for dynamic elements or interactions, additional scripting would be required.

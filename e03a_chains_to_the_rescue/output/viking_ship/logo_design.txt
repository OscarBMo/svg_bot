### Logo Elements

1. **Viking Ship**: The primary element of the logo will be the silhouette of a Viking ship. This consists of:

   - *Hull*: The main body of the ship, typically long and narrow. Should be designed in a silhouette form for the intended effect, in black color.
   
   - *Dragon Head*: This is characteristic to Viking ships, usually mounted at the prow. It should also be a silhouette in black color.

   - *Sail*: This should be represented as a large, square or slightly rectangular silhouette on a central mast, also in black color.

   - *Oars*: Depict the oars at regular intervals along the hull of the ship but keep them very subtle so as not to clutter the silhouette.

2. **Waves**: Underneath the Viking ship, waves should be depicted to convey that the ship is riding the waves. The design should incorporates smooth, flowing lines to create an impression of motion.

   - *Curve Lines*: Use several curve lines, forming arcs to demonstrate the waves in a stylised, abstract way. The lines are also to be colored black to maintain the silhouette effect.

All elements should be proportional and balanced, creating an overall cohesive design. The emphasis should be on simplicity and clarity, given that the logo is a silhouette. The resulting logo will give off a seafaring, adventurous tone.

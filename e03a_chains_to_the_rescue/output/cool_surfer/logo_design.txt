## Logo name
Cool Surfer

## Elements of the desired logo

1. **Surfer:** The surfer is the focal point of the logo. The surfer should be depicted as a cool, relaxed character, with a stylish hair-cut and wearing sunglasses. He should be standing one leg in front of the other on the surfboard, his arms slightly raised for balance. The colour scheme for the surfer could be different shades of blue and purple to match the surfing theme.

2. **Surfboard:** The surfboard the surfer is standing on should be a classic longboard type. It should be sleek and elongated, with pointed ends. The surfboard can have a design or pattern on it using multiple colours, though it should contrast nicely with the colour of the surfer and the wave. 

3. **Wave:** The wave is the second largest element in the logo after the surfer. The wave should be depicted as a large, curving body of water, sweeping upwards. The wave can be designed using distinct hues of blue, aqua and white at the crest to indicate foam.

4. **Background:** The background should include shades of light blues and whites – imitating a clear sky. It should not distract from the main elements – the surfer and the wave.

5. **Text:** The logo title "Cool Surfer" should be placed below the main graphic. The font should suggests motion and flow, aligning with the surfing theme. The color of the font could be a darker shade of the colors used in the design to make sure it stands out.

These elements should be arranged to show the surfer at the peak of the wave, symbolising thrill and adventure. The overall style of the design should be vibrant and dynamic to catch the viewer's eye.

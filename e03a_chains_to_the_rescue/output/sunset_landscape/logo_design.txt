## Draft SVG Logo Design: Sunset Landscape

### Elements:

**1. Sky:**
- The logo will begin with the background representing the sky. 
- The sky will have a gradient that is darkest at the top to represent dusk and lighter towards the bottom to depict the sunset. 
- Colors range from deep purple at the top to bright orange at the bottom.

**2. Sun:**
- The sun will be depicted near the bottom center of the logo, appearing as if it's about to set. 
- The sun will be represented as a bright yellow circle. 
- Apply a glimmer effect near the sun to create an impression of a sunset.

**3. Mountains:**
- Two separate mountain ranges will be depicted the best: one in the middle ground and one in the background.
- The nearer range of mountains will be darker (deep blue to black), and the further range will be a bit lighter (medium to light blue). This contrast will give a sense of depth to the scenery.
- The size of mountains will be big enough to be prominent but not so large as to dominate the scene.

**4. River:**
- A winding river will originate from the bottom center (near the sun), flowing towards the bottom right of the logo.
- The river color will be light blue with shades of yellow near the sun, achieving a reflection-like effect.
- The river's banks will appear a little rough, similar to a real river flowing through a landscape.

**5. Clouds (Optional):**
- Several small, fluffy clouds can be added in the sky with a light purple color.
- It can provide a more dramatic look to the sunset and add some details to the top of the logo.

The logo design elements aim to reflect a peaceful, serene, and beautiful sunset landscape with interesting elements like mountains and a river. The colors and design elements synergistically work together to present a striking logo.

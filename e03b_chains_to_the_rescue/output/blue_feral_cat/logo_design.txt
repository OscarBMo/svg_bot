- Logo Elements

1. Feral Cat:
   - Main Body: Depict a silhouette of a cat in a crouching position, as a typical pose of a feral animal. The silhouette should be detailed enough to showcase its feral or wild attributes, such as ragged fur and pointed ears. Since the logo intends to represent a feral cat, the body should be sleek and muscular, portraying the cat as intelligent and agile.
   - Eyes: The eyes should be intense and portrayed by two gleaming spots, giving an impression of a nocturnal and mysterious creature.
   - Color: Paint the full silhouette of the cat in a vibrant shade of blue. Considering different tones for the eye spot, fur, and body could add depth to the image.

2. Background:
   - For emphasis, keep the background of the logo simple and minimalist. A very light color or white can help to make the blue figure of the cat stand out.

3. Complementing Elements:
   - Elements like the ground, a dark alley, or hints of an urban scape can be included subtly to set the scene for the feral cat. However, these are optional and should be minimal, not to take away focus from the main element, which is the blue cat.

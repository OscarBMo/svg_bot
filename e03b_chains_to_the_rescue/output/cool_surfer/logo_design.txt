## Draft for SVG Logo Design

**1. Surfer:**
   The main element is the surfer. This surfer should be drawn in a simplified but clearly identifiable manner. 
   - Body: The body of the surfer should be stylized, potentially an abstract or geometric representation, wearing a surf suit. 
   - Surfboard: The surf gets a distinct color to emphasize it. The surfboard should be long and slightly curved, slim in design to reflect the look of a real surfboard.
   - Pose: The surfer should be posed in a classic surfing stance: one foot at the front of the board, one foot at the back, and body slightly crouched for balance.

**2. Wave:**
   - Shape: The wave will need to be larger in size than the surfer, curved in nature, signifying a large and powerful wave. This can either be a single or a double wave.
   - Color: The color of the wave should preferably be varying shades of blue to realistically represent water.
   - Texture: The wave texture should be presented with occasional white lines or dots to depict foaming water at the crest of the wave.

**3. Surrounding (optional):**
   - Sky: Adding a sky could provide context if desired, with a light blue horizontal rectangle behind the surfer and the wave.
   - Sun: A cool yellow sun, possibly with light rays, can be placed in the sky for an added touch. 

Overall, this logo design should depict a "cool surfer" and should keep a color palette that gives off a cool, beachy vibe.

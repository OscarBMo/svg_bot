## Decomposed Elements

### 1. Sky
The sky should span across the entire logo and should be designed to capture a sunset setting. Colors should range from dark blue at the top, blending into shades of orange, pink, and yellow towards the horizon line.

### 2. Sun
Place a semicircular sun at the horizon line to the right side. The sun should be intense yellow, to bring out the contrast against the colorful sky.

### 3. Mountains
Range of mountains should be designed in silhouette, placing them against the colorful sunset sky. The mountains should be varied in height to form an interesting landscape. The silhouette of the mountains should be in dark shades - black or very dark blue.

### 4. River
A river should flow from the foreground towards the mountains on the horizon line. The river should be shaped as a wavy line, broader in the foreground gradually tapering and weaving its way towards the mountains, where it disappears. It should reflect the colors of the sunset sky in a mosaic style.

### 5. Ground
In the foreground, there should be a ground, colored in darker tones. The ground could be either flat or slightly uneven to give more depth to the landscape. Make it look like an undulating field or a gentle slope leading down to the river. 

These elements collectively would build a beautiful logo that encapsulates the beauty of a 'Sunset Landscape'.
